>>>Using Git:
git pull
(play around with code)
git add
git commit
git push
(git status) to check what's going on
(on qt nuuc) copy/replace updated file in catkin_ws/src to run

>>>Using Catkin WS:
cd into catkin_ws/src
create a package: catkin_create_pkg pkgname (lowercase # _)
cd into pkgname
mkdir scripts
cd into scripts
put all the python/code files in scripts
(in the ~/.bashrc file add lines at the end:
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.sh
then in catkin_ws/devel run source ~/.bashrc)
cd out to catkin_ws
catkin_make
(roscd pkgname) to see if pkgname is in catkin ws
(first time - cd into pkgname/scripts, run: chmod +x script.py)
rosrun pkgname script.py

>>>QT Stuff:
there is a gesture game app @ ~/robot/code/qt_apps/qt_gesturegame_app/src/qt_gesturegame_app.cpp
in catkin_ws: rosnode list to see node names
when writing scripts use unique node names to avoid overwriting qt gui
QT can use the talkText publisher at a rate of ~10 characters/1 second with rospy.sleep(#) after the publish command

>>>ROS:
in order to play with roscore, new commands need to be run in an new terminal window while roscore is still open in its window
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM#S
rostopic echo pushed

>>Camera
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.100.1:11311 (QT master uri)
export ROS_IP=10.42.0.149 (my or CK's computer)

>>Beaglebone
get on slab1 wifi (shared wifi with beaglebone)
ssh root@beaglebone.local
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
open 3 terminals - one for roscore, one for the data collection script, one for python
1) roscore
2) cd ~/openWearable/apps
./bin/pam-thumbs-test -r (-r to upload to ros)
3) cd ~/NumberGame
git pull (for any updates)
python NumberGame.py

>>>Arduino
install rosserial libraries (search on library manager) + restart to see rosserial examples
or use https://github.com/ros-drivers/rosserial
if errors with port try running these commands from root:
ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM# (as listed)
possible reasons for issue:
-arduino cannot communicate with computer when running pam lib
-look up how libraries work in arduino
-pam could be interfering with serial communication to computer (maybe air board has serial communication to arduino maybe the computer serial communication is bad at sharing if theres only one serial port)
