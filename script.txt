[intro1]<prosody rate="x-slow">Hello, my name is QT Robot. What is your name?
[intro2]<prosody rate="x-slow">Hi Aprille I would like to play a guessing game with you. In the game, I ask you questions, and you answer yes or no by using a thumbs up or a thumbs down with your right hand.
[intro3]Let’s practice.  Can you show me a thumbs up to say yes?
[intro4]Awesome! Now can you show me a thumbs down to say no?
[intro5]Thanks! During the game, please keep your hand flat on the arm rest until I ask you a question. If your thumb is going the wrong way, just push the green button. And just do your best. Can you please show me yes if that’s ok?
[startgame]Let's play now! Please think of a number between 1 and 50.
