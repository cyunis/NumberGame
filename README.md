# QTNumberGame and NumberGame
Games for the summer 2019 Tommy Thumb study - both are in the folder "Final Versions"

## QTNumberGame
This game is part of the Tommy Thumb system. It is meant to be played on the [QTRobot built by LuxAI](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/qtrobot) running ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. The game is run during an experimental set up combined with several other subsystems (each on their own computer/microprocessor): [orthosis](https://github.com/jonreal/openWearable/tree/thumbsup), [camera](https://github.com/HeegerGao/USC), and EMG. 

Before running the game a package must be made for the games and the catkin workspace set up. Several functions in the game use ROS publishers developed on QT or through the other subsystems and these must be set up as well (see links for QTRobot wiki, orthosis and camera).
